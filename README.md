# Password-Generator
Challenge 3

## Description
Our employeer wanted us to make a secure password generate that could help us make the strongest password possible. They wanted the password to have a minimum of 8 characters and a max of 128. Then, we are given a choice as to how we wanted this password to contain. Our choices are: numbers, lowercase and/or uppercase letters, and/or special characters. Onced these prompts are completed we should have our random generater deposit a password to our specifications in the password box so we can copy and use it. There are also checks through out to make sure we pick a number in the given lenght and choice atleast 1 added character.
